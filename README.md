# AI Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing using Deep Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment. Using IoT sensor data from the C-MAPSS dataset, the system predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines, helping prevent unexpected machine failures and reducing downtime in manufacturing environments.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Unexpected equipment breakdowns lead to production losses, increased costs, and compromised safety. Traditional maintenance strategies like reactive or preventive maintenance are inefficient:

- **Reactive Maintenance:** Fix machines only after failure → unplanned downtime.  
- **Preventive Maintenance:** Scheduled maintenance at fixed intervals → wasted resources.

**Objective:** Develop an AI-driven predictive maintenance system that can analyze time-series sensor data, detect anomalies, and forecast equipment failures in advance.

## 🧩 Objectives
1. Collect and preprocess IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, current, etc.).  
2. Implement and compare deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) for predicting RUL.  
3. Normalize and sequence sensor data for time-series modeling.  
4. Train models and evaluate using metrics like MSE, MAE.  
5. Visualize actual vs predicted RUL.  
6. Deploy models for real-time monitoring (optional future step).
